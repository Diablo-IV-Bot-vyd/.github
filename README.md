# Diablo IV Bot – Let the Bot Do the Grinding 🧟‍♀️💰

## Why Use a Bot in Diablo IV?

Diablo IV’s vast open-world and farming loops can be time-consuming. Bots like **Orion**, **Atlas Assist**, and community scripts take over the grind: they **auto‑navigate zones, fight monsters, pick up loot, heal, repair gear, and even sell items**—ideal for solo PvE or grinding in private sessions .

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethical Considerations

* **Botting is against TOS**—account suspension or bans are possible
* **Always farm in private/world phase sessions** to reduce detection
* **Avoid token-leeching or real-money farming setups** (they escalate detection risks)
* **Community bots like Orion & Atlas Assist** offer stealthier solutions for private sessions 
* Large-scale gold farming may trigger bans or bot sweeps&#x20;
